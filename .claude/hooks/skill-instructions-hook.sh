REQUIRED: SKILL LOADING PROTOCOL

Before writing any code, complete these steps in order:

1. SCAN each skill below and decide: LOAD or SKIP (with brief reason)
   - react
   - typescript
   - tailwind
   - react-router
   - vite
   - radix-ui
   - frontend-design
   - material-ui
   - react-hook-form
   - emotion
   - framer-motion
   - recharts
   - date-fns
   - lucide-react
   - sonner
   - react-dnd
   - embla-carousel
   - react-resizable-panels
   - next-themes
   - cmdk
   - vaul
   - react-responsive-masonry

2. For every skill marked LOAD → immediately invoke Skill(name)
   If none need loading → write "Proceeding without skills"

3. Only after step 2 completes may you begin coding.

IMPORTANT: Skipping step 2 invalidates step 1. Always call Skill() for relevant items.

Sample output:
- react: LOAD - building components
- typescript: SKIP - not needed for this task
- tailwind: LOAD - building components
- react-router: SKIP - not needed for this task

Then call:
> Skill(react)
> Skill(tailwind)

Now implementation can begin.
